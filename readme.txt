Description of code

Simulation scripts:

sim_SIRvSD.m (SIR vs source density) 	- this simulation script generates the results for Figure 5
sim_SIRvT.m (SIR vs time)		- this simulation script generates the results for Figure 6

Plotting scripts:

fig_fluxScaling.m 			- plots the results as shown in Figure 2
fig_Haslam.m				- plots the Haslam map as shown in Figure 3
fig_SIRvSD.m 				- plots the results as shown in Figure 5
fig_SIRvT.m				- plots the results as shown in Figure 6	

"results" folder contains the outputs of the simulation scripts
"data" folder contains data used by the simulation scripts. 


all other scripts are dependencies of the simulation scripts
